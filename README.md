# PigDiceGame

Pig Dice is a simple and entertaining dice game that can be played with two or more players. The goal of the game is to reach a certain number of points, typically 100, before your opponents do.

# Rules of the Game:

1. The game is played with a standard set of six-sided dice.
2. Players take turns rolling the dice.
3. On your turn, you start by rolling the dice.
4. If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and you score no points for that round.
5. If you roll any number other than 1, you can choose to either roll again and accumulate more points or end your turn and bank your accumulated points.
6. If you decide to roll again, the points you earn in that roll are added to your round score. You can continue rolling as long as you avoid rolling a 1.
7. However, if you roll a 1 at any point during your turn, all the accumulated points in that round are lost, and your turn ends.
8. Once you decide to end your turn and bank your points, your round score is added to your total score.
9. The game continues with the next player taking their turn.
10. The first player to reach the predetermined winning score, usually 100, is declared the winner.
